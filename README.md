Hello, my name is Francisco Medina, 
  and I am currently a student in the Artificial Intelligence & Robotics program (ITAI 2373). My academic focus is on understanding how intelligent systems interact with the physical world through sensors, actuators, and embedded computing. This repository documents my work on building, configuring, and programming the Raspberry Pi Car 5, a hands-on robotics project designed to strengthen my skills in Python, Linux, computer vision, and hardware-software integration.

Project Overview

This repository serves as the complete development portfolio for my Raspberry Pi Car 5 project. It includes:

-Setup instructions for the Raspberry PiCar 5 and Robot HAT controller

-Module-by-module documentation of experiments, testing scripts, and results

-Final project development, including lessons learned and future improvements

The goal of this repository is to show all stages of building and programming the robot, from initial configuration to functional movement tests, to more advanced features such as camera control, ultrasonic sensing, and autonomous steering logic.

This GitHub will act as:

-A technical archive of my work

-A reference for future robotics projects

-A showcase of my growing skills in embedded AI and robotic systems
